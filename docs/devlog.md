## April 19 -- Initial work
Started stubbing out the project and considering what needs to be created for an MVP.  Right now I am leaning towards a very basic matchmaking system that starts everyone off at a new mmr.  I want to start developing an architectural document mostly with an eye on what to start first.

I am also a bit unfamiliar with standard github workflows.  I am leaning towards trunk based feature development, with daily branches for random updates such as this devlog and other odds and ends.

## April 20 -- Begin MVP
Today I will start in earnest.  Figuring out what is available  through the [Blizzard's API](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api) has published for StarCraft is definitely the first step, as well as publishing some draft architecture that starts to detail what things will look like.
