## ðŸ§° Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it to your machine.
2. Create a branch for your feature or fix.

## ðŸ”Ž Code Style & Practices

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Write clean, self-documenting code. It's okay to be iterativeâ€”just be open to pull request feedback and refactoring.
- If unsure, open an issue before starting workâ€”we're happy to discuss!

## ðŸ“¢ Communication & Feedback

We want to keep things constructive and low-drama. If you have feedback, concerns, or want to propose a big idea, please:

- Use GitHub Issues for structured discussions
- Be specific and solution-oriented
